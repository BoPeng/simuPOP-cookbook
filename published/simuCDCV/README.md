Reich and Lander's 2001 paper "On the allelic spectrum of human disease"
proposed a population genetics framework to model the evolution of 
allelic spectra. The model is based on the fact that human population
grew quickly from around 10,000 to 6 billion in 18,000 -150,000 years.
Their analysis showed that at the founder population, both common and
rare diseases have simple spectra. After the sudden expansion of 
population size, the allelic spectra of simple diseases become complex;
while those of complex diseases remained simple.

This script simulates the evolution of a disease using a more complicated
version of this evolutionary process. The allelic spectrum is observed, 
recorded and plotted (if R/Rpy is available).
