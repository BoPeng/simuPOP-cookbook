#  simuPOP Examples

## Demonstration of basic population genetics models

This selection lists simple examples that demonstrates the classical population genetics models.
* [GeneticDrift](GeneticDrift.py) Changes of allele frequency due to genetic drift.

* [DecayOfLD](DecayOfLD.py) Decay of Linkage disequilibrium due to recombination.

* [MutationSelectionEquilibrium](MutationSelectionEquilibrium.py) Allele frequency changes due to directional mutation

* [NumOfAncestors](NumOfAncestors.py) Count the number of ancestors to a DNA sequence

* [HWE](HWE.py) This program demonstrate the Hardy-weinberg equilibrium when the allele frequencies in females and males are different.

* [Migration](Migration.py) Changes of allele frequencies among subpopulations due to migration

* [Overdominance](Overdominance.py) Evolution of a neutral locus partially linked to a multiallelic target of balancing selection in two closely related species.

* [PopStructure](PopStructure.py) This script simulates three subpopulations that become more and more genetically distinct during evolution. Population structure is estimated using two popular statistics.

* [SelectiveSweep](SelectiveSweep.py) Amplification (or reduction) of variation in nucleotides in neighboring DNA because of natural selection.

## Customized Operators

* [pyOperator](pyOperator.py) An example about during-mating and post-mating Python operators.

* [SpatialMigration](SpatialMigration.py) A function to generate a migration rate matrix for a 2D spatial migration model.

* [haplodiploidMating](haplodiploidMating.py) Recombination in haplodiploid populations.


## Customized mating schemes

* [Selfing](Selfing.py) Partial self-fertilization.

* [OverlappingGenerations](OverlappingGenerations.py) Overlapping generations.

* [AssortativeMating](AssortativeMating.py) Assortative mating.

* [PythonParentChooser](PythonParentChooser.py) Python parent chooser

* [CppLevelParentChooser](CppLevelParentChooser.py) A Python parent chooser implemented at the C++ level.

* [Mitochondrial](Mitochondrial.py) Evolution of mitochondrial chromosomes.

## Evolutionary scenarios

* [RestartIfFailed](RestartIfFailed.py) Restart an evolution if the frequency of an allele is not within specified range.

* [FollowFreqTrajectory](FollowFreqTrajectory.py) Run a smaller simulation and record allele frequency trajectory, follow this frequency trajectory in subsequent multiple replicate simulations.
