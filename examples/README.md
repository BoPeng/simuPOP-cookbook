## Demonstration of basic population genetics models

This selection lists simple examples that demonstrates the classical population genetics models.
* [[Cookbook/GeneticDrift]] Changes of allele frequency due to genetic drift.

* [[Cookbook/DecayOfLD]] Decay of Linkage disequilibrium due to recombination.

* [[Cookbook/MutationSelectionEquilibrium]] Allele frequency changes due to directional mutation

* [[Cookbook/NumOfAncestors]] Count the number of ancestors to a DNA sequence

* [[Cookbook/HWE]] This program demonstrate the Hardy-weinberg equilibrium when the allele frequencies in females and males are different.

* [[Cookbook/Migration]] Changes of allele frequencies among subpopulations due to migration

* [[Cookbook/Overdominance]] Evolution of a neutral locus partially linked to a multiallelic target of balancing selection in two closely related species.

* [[Cookbook/PopStructure]] This script simulates three subpopulations that become more and more genetically distinct during evolution. Population structure is estimated using two popular statistics.

* [[Cookbook/SelectiveSweep]] Amplification (or reduction) of variation in nucleotides in neighboring DNA because of natural selection.

## Customized Operators

* [[Cookbook/pyOperator]] An example about during-mating and post-mating Python operators.

* [[Cookbook/SpatialMigration]] A function to generate a migration rate matrix for a 2D spatial migration model.

* [[Cookbook/haplodiploidMating]] Recombination in haplodiploid populations.


## Customized mating schemes

* [[Cookbook/Selfing]] Partial self-fertilization.

* [[Cookbook/OverlappingGenerations]] Overlapping generations.

* [[Cookbook/AssortativeMating]] Assortative mating.

* [[Cookbook/PythonParentChooser]] Python parent chooser

* [[Cookbook/CppLevelParentChooser]] A Python parent chooser implemented at the C++ level.

* [[Cookbook/Mitochondrial]] Evolution of mitochondrial chromosomes.

## Evolutionary scenarios

* [[Cookbook/RestartIfFailed]] Restart an evolution if the frequency of an allele is not within specified range.

* [[Cookbook/FollowFreqTrajectory]] Run a smaller simulation and record allele frequency trajectory, follow this frequency trajectory in subsequent multiple replicate simulations.
