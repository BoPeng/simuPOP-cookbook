#  simuPOP Examples

## Demonstration of basic population genetics models

This selection lists simple examples that demonstrates the classical population genetics models.
* [GeneticDrift](GeneticDrift.py) Changes of allele frequency due to genetic drift.

* [Cookbook/DecayOfLD](Cookbook/DecayOfLD) Decay of Linkage disequilibrium due to recombination.

* [Cookbook/MutationSelectionEquilibrium](Cookbook/MutationSelectionEquilibrium) Allele frequency changes due to directional mutation

* [Cookbook/NumOfAncestors](Cookbook/NumOfAncestors) Count the number of ancestors to a DNA sequence

* [Cookbook/HWE](Cookbook/HWE) This program demonstrate the Hardy-weinberg equilibrium when the allele frequencies in females and males are different.

* [Cookbook/Migration](Cookbook/Migration) Changes of allele frequencies among subpopulations due to migration

* [Cookbook/Overdominance](Cookbook/Overdominance) Evolution of a neutral locus partially linked to a multiallelic target of balancing selection in two closely related species.

* [Cookbook/PopStructure](Cookbook/PopStructure) This script simulates three subpopulations that become more and more genetically distinct during evolution. Population structure is estimated using two popular statistics.

* [Cookbook/SelectiveSweep](Cookbook/SelectiveSweep) Amplification (or reduction) of variation in nucleotides in neighboring DNA because of natural selection.

## Customized Operators

* [Cookbook/pyOperator](Cookbook/pyOperator) An example about during-mating and post-mating Python operators.

* [Cookbook/SpatialMigration](Cookbook/SpatialMigration) A function to generate a migration rate matrix for a 2D spatial migration model.

* [Cookbook/haplodiploidMating](Cookbook/haplodiploidMating) Recombination in haplodiploid populations.


## Customized mating schemes

* [Cookbook/Selfing](Cookbook/Selfing) Partial self-fertilization.

* [Cookbook/OverlappingGenerations](Cookbook/OverlappingGenerations) Overlapping generations.

* [Cookbook/AssortativeMating](Cookbook/AssortativeMating) Assortative mating.

* [Cookbook/PythonParentChooser](Cookbook/PythonParentChooser) Python parent chooser

* [Cookbook/CppLevelParentChooser](Cookbook/CppLevelParentChooser) A Python parent chooser implemented at the C++ level.

* [Cookbook/Mitochondrial](Cookbook/Mitochondrial) Evolution of mitochondrial chromosomes.

## Evolutionary scenarios

* [Cookbook/RestartIfFailed](Cookbook/RestartIfFailed) Restart an evolution if the frequency of an allele is not within specified range.

* [Cookbook/FollowFreqTrajectory](Cookbook/FollowFreqTrajectory) Run a smaller simulation and record allele frequency trajectory, follow this frequency trajectory in subsequent multiple replicate simulations.
