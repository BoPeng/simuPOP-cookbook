#  simuPOP Examples

## Demonstration of basic population genetics models

This selection lists simple examples that demonstrates the classical population genetics models.
* [GeneticDrift](simuGeneticDrift.py) Changes of allele frequency due to genetic drift.

* [DecayOfLD](simuLDDecay.py) Decay of Linkage disequilibrium due to recombination.

* [MutationSelectionEquilibrium](simuMutationSelEquili.py) Allele frequency changes due to directional mutation

* [NumOfAncestors](simuNumOfAncestors.py) Count the number of ancestors to a DNA sequence

* [HWE](simuHWE.py) This program demonstrate the Hardy-weinberg equilibrium when the allele frequencies in females and males are different.

* [Migration](simuMigration.py) Changes of allele frequencies among subpopulations due to migration

<!--- * [Overdominance](Overdominance.py) Evolution of a neutral locus partially linked to a multiallelic target of balancing selection in two closely related species. -->

* [PopStructure](popStructure.py) This script simulates three subpopulations that become more and more genetically distinct during evolution. Population structure is estimated using two popular statistics.

* [SelectiveSweep](SelectiveSweep.py) Amplification (or reduction) of variation in nucleotides in neighboring DNA because of natural selection.

## Customized Operators

* [pyOperator](pyOperator.py) An example about during-mating and post-mating Python operators.

<!--- * [SpatialMigration](SpatialMigration.py) A function to generate a migration rate matrix for a 2D spatial migration model. -->

<!--- * [haplodiploidMating](haplodiploidMating.py) Recombination in haplodiploid populations. -->


## Customized mating schemes

* [Selfing](selfing.py) Partial self-fertilization.

* [OverlappingGenerations](overlappingGeneration.py) Overlapping generations.

* [AssortativeMating](assortativeMating.py) Assortative mating.

* [PythonParentChooser](pythonParentChooser.py) Python parent chooser

<!--- * [CppLevelParentChooser](CppLevelParentChooser.py) A Python parent chooser implemented at the C++ level. -->

* [Mitochondrial](mitochondrial.py) Evolution of mitochondrial chromosomes.

## Evolutionary scenarios

* [RestartIfFailed](restartIfFailed.py) Restart an evolution if the frequency of an allele is not within specified range.

* [FollowFreqTrajectory](followFreqTraj.py) Run a smaller simulation and record allele frequency trajectory, follow this frequency trajectory in subsequent multiple replicate simulations.
